Using build123d, create components with props in init() like self.props.prop1, and the build123d render in render() which references but does not change self.props, with docstrings and type annotations:

### 2x aluminum pizza pan + 2x pairs magnetic laptop stands ($2+~$20)
- 2x 13" wide rim pizza pans
- 2x pairs (4 total) silicone magnetic laptop risers  (with the same dimensions as like in workboard #workboard01.py #workboard01.md )
  - the feet space the pans apart so that the heat escapes under the laptop (gpu)

  - 1x simplified 15.6" laptop open above the pans


> Copilot: To implement your request using build123d, I will create Python classes for each component (pizza pan, magnetic laptop riser/feet, and simplified laptop) with:
> 
> - Props set in `__init__` (using a `props` object or dict, e.g., `self.props.diameter`)
> - A `render()` method that uses build123d to generate the geometry, referencing but not modifying `self.props`
> - Docstrings and type annotations
> 
> I will place these in a new file, e.g., `pizzapancoolingmat.py` in the pizzapancoolingmat directory.
> 
> The classes will be:
> - `PizzaPanComponent`
> - `MagneticLaptopRiserComponent`
> - `LaptopComponent`
> - `PizzaPanCoolingMatAssembly` (combines the above)
> 
> I will now create this file with the described structure and code. The file pizzapancoolingmat.py is created with build123d-based parametric components for your passive laptop cooling mat:
> 
> - Each class uses `props` in `__init__` and references them in `render()`
> - Docstrings and type annotations are included
> - The assembly class combines 2 pizza pans, 4 risers, and a simplified laptop
> 
> You can now use or extend these components for further modeling or visualization. Let me know if you want example usage, visualization code, or integration with other files.

move all props defaults from render to init

> Copilot: I will refactor the code so that all default values for props are set in the `__init__` methods of each component class, rather than in the `render` methods. This will make the props explicit and immutable after initialization, as requested. 
> ````
> 
> ````
> All props defaults have been moved from the `render` methods to the `__init__` methods of each component class. Now, defaults are set during initialization and are explicit and immutable for each instance.
> 
> Let me know if you need usage examples, further refactoring, or visualization code.

In #main.py, Create a main()  method to init and render the PizzaPanCoolingMatAssembly

> Copilot: I will create a `main()` function in `main.py` that initializes and renders the `PizzaPanCoolingMatAssembly` using the default props. The function will also include a simple entry point (`if __name__ == "__main__": main()`). For visualization, I'll use build123d's `show` function if available.

> Let's proceed. 
> ````
> 
> ````
> The `main.py` file now contains a `main()` function that initializes and renders the `PizzaPanCoolingMatAssembly`. However, there are import errors:
> 
> - `"PizzaPanCoolingMatAssembly" is unknown import symbol` (likely due to missing `__init__.py` or incorrect import path)
> - `"show" is unknown import symbol` (the `show` function may not exist or may need a different import)
> 
> Would you like me to fix the import issues, or provide alternative visualization code?

Add argparse ArgumentParser in a testable function in #file:main.py , and create pytest tests for it in #file:test_main.py 

> Copilot: I will:
> 1. Refactor `main.py` to add an `argparse.ArgumentParser` in a testable function (e.g., `run_with_args(args)`).
> 2. Create pytest tests in `test_main.py` to test argument parsing and function behavior.
> 
> Let's proceed. 
> ````
> 
> ````
> 
> ````
> 
> ````
> - `main.py` now has a testable `run_with_args(args)` function using `argparse`, and the main entry point calls it.
> - `test_main.py` contains pytest tests for default and custom argument parsing.
> 
> There are still import errors for `PizzaPanCoolingMatAssembly` and `show`, and pytest is not installed. Would you like help fixing the import paths or installing pytest?
