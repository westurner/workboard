# Passive laptop cooling system

## Goal
Create a passive laptop cooling assembly out of low-cost components that can be DIY constructed with.

## Existing solutions

- workboard wooden board 
- aluminum pizza pan ($1)

## New solution

Using build123d, create components with all props defaults in init() like self.props.prop1, and the build123d render in render() which references but does not change self.props, with docstrings and type annotations:

### 2x aluminum pizza pan + 2x pairs magnetic laptop stands ($2+~$20)
- 2x 13" wide rim pizza pans
- 2x pairs (4 total) silicone magnetic laptop risers  (with the same dimensions as like in workboard #workboard01.py #workboard01.md )
  - the feet space the pans apart so that the heat escapes under the laptop (gpu)

  - 1x simplified 15.6" laptop open above the pans


## eval
advantages:
- cost
- parts availability
- machine washable

disadvantages / opportunities:

- doesn't fold for travel
- the magnetic feet slip
- a third pan would make it swivel-able
